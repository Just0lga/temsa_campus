# TEMSA-Campus-App
During my internship at TEMSA, I prepared the email confirmation feature for the companyâ€™s internal campus mobile application. I integrated this functionality by transforming a pre-developed backend and Figma design into a fully functional and presentable mobile interface using Flutter, Swagger, and Postman. The backend API was already provided and private, so I cannot share the code publicly. However, I was responsible for connecting the API, ensuring smooth integration, and delivering a UI that was both presentation-ready and suitable for real-world use.
